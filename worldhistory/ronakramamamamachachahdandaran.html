  And the cool evening's benison,<br>
By that last sunset touch that lay<br>
  Upon the hills where day was done,<br>
By beauty lavisghly outpoured<br>
  And blessings carelessly received,<br>
By all the days that I have lived<br>
  Make me a soldier, Lord.<br>
By all of man's hopes and fears,<br>
  And all the wonders poets sing,<br>
The laughter of unclouded years,<br>
  And every sad and lovely thing;<br>
By the romantic ages stored<br>
  With high endeavor that was his,<br>
By all his mad catastrophes<br>
  Make me a man, O Lord.<br>
I, that on my familiar hill<br>
  Saw with uncomprehending eyes<br>
A hundred of Thy sunsets spill<br>
  Their fresh and sanguine sacrifice,<br>
Ere the sun swings his noonday sword<br>
  Must say goodbye to all of this;--<br>
By all delights that I shall miss,<br>
  Help me to die, O Lord.<br>

    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 20px">The tone of this poem is somber and melancholy. Hodgson uses anaphora by repeating "By" at the beginning of almost every phrase, and also uses parallel structure with "Make me a soldier, O Lord," and "Make me a man, O Lord." The final one, "Help me to die, O Lord," is a little different; more conclusive. This poem tells the story of a life. It starts off with ambitions to become a soldier and a man and ends with death and more appreciation for the beauty of life. Regret is prevalent throughout the poem with statements like "blessings carelessly received," but so is pride and glory. This poem romanticizes war, and treats dying for one's country as a "high endeavor" called for directly by God.  </h3>

	<p style ="font-family: Lato; font-size: 16px"><br>They ask me where I've been,<br>
And what I've done and seen.<br>
But what can I reply<br>
Who know it wasn't I,<br>
But someone just like me,<br>
Who went across the sea<br>
And with my head and hands<br>
Killed men in foreign lands...<br>
Though I must bear the blame,<br>
Because he bore my name.<br>

</h3>    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 20px">
This poem is my personal favorite. The soldier speaking uses a sort of metaphor to explain the feeling he's left with after the war. He did unspeakable things during the war that he regrets, but he feels disconnected from his actions. He finds it hard to believe that he is the same person who fought in the distant nightmare that was the war. I liked this poem because I think it very accurately sums up how a soldier must feel once war is over, but it does this in a way I've never seen before.</h3>
