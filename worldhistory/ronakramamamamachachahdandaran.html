	<p style ="font-family: Lato; font-size: 16px"><br>By all the glories of the day<br>
  And the cool evening's benison,<br>
By that last sunset touch that lay<br>
  Upon the hills where day was done,<br>
By beauty lavisghly outpoured<br>
  And blessings carelessly received,<br>
By all the days that I have lived<br>
  Make me a soldier, Lord.<br>
By all of man's hopes and fears,<br>
  And all the wonders poets sing,<br>
The laughter of unclouded years,<br>
  And every sad and lovely thing;<br>
By the romantic ages stored<br>
  With high endeavor that was his,<br>
By all his mad catastrophes<br>
  Make me a man, O Lord.<br>
I, that on my familiar hill<br>
  Saw with uncomprehending eyes<br>
A hundred of Thy sunsets spill<br>
  Their fresh and sanguine sacrifice,<br>
Ere the sun swings his noonday sword<br>
  Must say goodbye to all of this;--<br>
By all delights that I shall miss,<br>
  Help me to die, O Lord.<br>

    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 20px">The tone of this poem is somber and melancholy. Hodgson uses anaphora by repeating "By" at the beginning of almost every phrase, and also uses parallel structure with "Make me a soldier, O Lord," and "Make me a man, O Lord." The final one, "Help me to die, O Lord," is a little different; more conclusive. This poem tells the story of a life. It starts off with ambitions to become a soldier and a man and ends with death and more appreciation for the beauty of life. Regret is prevalent throughout the poem with statements like "blessings carelessly received," but so is pride and glory. This poem romanticizes war, and treats dying for one's country as a "high endeavor" called for directly by God.  </h3>

And what I've done and seen.<br>
But what can I reply<br>
Who know it wasn't I,<br>

And with my head and hands<br>
Killed men in foreign lands...<br>
Though I must bear the blame,<br>
Because he bore my name.<br>

This poem is my personal favorite. The soldier speaking uses a sort of metaphor to explain the feeling he's left with after the war. He did unspeakable things during the war that he regrets, but he feels disconnected from his actions. He finds it hard to believe that he is the same person who fought in the distant nightmare that was the war. I liked this poem because I think it very accurately sums up how a soldier must feel once war is over, but it does this in a way I've never seen before.</h3>

	<h2 style ="color:grey; font-family: Open Sans; font-weight: light; font-size: 22px;">by Philip Larkin</h2>
	<br>
	</div>  
	<blockquote>
	<p style ="font-family: Lato; font-size: 16px"><br>Those long uneven lines<br>
Standing as patiently<br>
As if they were stretched outside<br>
The Oval or Villa Park,<br>
The crowns of hats, the sun<br>
On moustached archaic faces<br>
Grinning as if it were all<br>
An August Bank Holiday lark;<br>
<br>
And the shut shops, the bleached<br>
Established names on the sunblinds,<br>
The farthings and sovereigns,<br>
And dark-clothed children at play<br>
Called after kings and queens,<br>
The tin advertisements<br>
For cocoa and twist, and the pubs<br>
Wide open all day;<br>
<br>
And the countryside not caring<br>
The place-names all hazed over<br>
With flowering grasses, and fields<br>
Shadowing Domesday lines<br>
Under wheats' restless silence;<br>
The differently-dressed servants<br>
With tiny rooms in huge houses,<br>
The dust behind limousines;<br>
<br>
Never such innocence,<br>
Never before or since,<br>
As changed itself to past<br>
Without a word--the men<br>
Leaving the gardens tidy,<br>
The thousands of marriages<br>
Lasting a little while longer:<br>
Never such innocence again.<br>

    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 20px">The roman numeral MCMXIV is 1914, the year that WWI broke out. This poem is about how innocent and unknowing the people were when they left to fight. They had seen and fought in wars before, but WWI was different because of the advances in weaponry that had been made. Maxim machine guns and hidden mines along with trench warfare made the war much more gruesome. The poem is broken into four verses. The first verse explains how unassuming, naive and somewhat eager the soldiers were to go off to war. It gives the tone of being relaxed, in a way Larkin envies and also disapproves. The second and third describe the country, towns, and cities, void of the majority of men who are leaving to fight. Shops are empty, but otherwise, life will continue normally. The fourth and final verse is in sharp contrast regretful and reminiscent. Particularly ominous is the phrase, "The thousands of marriages Lasting a little while longer," which brings to mind the millions of marriages cut short abruptly by the war. Larkin makes it clear that the war left a permanent mark on the daily lives of everyone.

Beside me, other Brits and French<br>
Drop like flies as bullets drench<br>

With worldwide mad disharmony <br>
How is it that we keep the peace?<br>
Blood and iron, all agree<br>
As if they see no irony<br>
<br>
With maxims as the guns to pick<br>
To kill in conflicts with a click<br>
Saving lives by taking lives<br>
As if these two things don't conflict<br>
<br>
Through deathly sadness, blood and gore<br>
The weight of loss we proudly bore<br>
But this the world chose to ignore<br>
When they declared we won the war<br>
