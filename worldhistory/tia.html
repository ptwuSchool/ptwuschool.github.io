	<blockquote>
	<p style ="font-family: Lato; font-size: 16px"><br>Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,<br>
Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,<br>
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs<br>
And towards our distant rest began to trudge.<br>
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots<br>
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;<br>
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots<br>
Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.<br>
<br>
Gas! GAS! Quick, boys! -- An ecstasy of fumbling,<br>
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;<br>
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling<br>
And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime . . .<br>
Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,<br>
As under I green sea, I saw him drowning.<br>
<br>
In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,<br>
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.<br>
<br>
If in some smothering dreams you too could pace<br>
Behind the wagon that we flung him in,<br>
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,<br>
His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;<br>
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood<br>
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,<br>
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud<br>
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, --<br>
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest<br>
To children ardent for some desperate glory,<br>
The old lie: <i>Dulce et decorum est</i><br>
Pro patria mori.<br>

	<div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 20px">This poem speaks about another day of battle in World War I. The tone of the poem is tired and hopeless. In the first stanza Wilfred Owen, talking about the soldiers everyday marching uses phrases such as "began to trudge", "marched asleep", "limped on" and "drunk with fatigue". These phrases show a tired tone because it is evident that the war is physically and mentally draining all the soldiers. Additionally, the language suggests a slow and draining sound. In the second stanza, Wilfred Owen, talking about seeing his comrade die from the gas, uses terms such as "drowning", "incurable", and "froth-corrupted" to show the hopeless tone. The language that the poet uses suggests that all hope is lost, and that there is no way to come back. Moreover, Wilfred retells this image in the poem because he his comrade was hopeless in that moment, and he could do nothing to help save him. In addition, Wilfred Owen shows symbolism in the poem when speaking about the gas that was dropped on the soldiers. The gas masks that the soldiers were forced to wear when the gas was dropped on them can also symbolize how the war in general forced the soldiers who fought in it to put on a "mask" as a changed person after the war ended. This poem enhanced my understanding of the war because it showed me how the everyday warlife of the soldiers was tiresome and a bit helpless. Additionally, it showed me how the people who fought in this war were scarred with memories of their comrades dying. Lastly, it taught me how big of a role the gas played in the war.

His strin'd hands clench an ice-cold rifle,<br>
His aching jaws grip a hot parch'd tongue,<br>
His wide eyes search unconsciously.<br>
<br>
He cannot shriek.<br>
<br>
Bloody saliva<br>
Dribbles down his shapeless jacket.<br>

I saw him stab<br>
And stab again<br>

This is the happy warrior,<br>
This is he...<br>

	<div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 20px">This poem talks about the warrior that all men in arms are. The soldiers are all struggling and in pain, but to everyone else, they look like powerful, strong, and happy warriors. The tone of this poem is contradictory and vengeful. In the first stanza Herbert Read speaking about this "happy warrior", uses phrases such as; "His wild heart beats with painful sobs", and "His aching jaws". This is contradictory because the title of the poem is 'The Happy Warrior', but evidently this soldier is in pain, and is aching, therefore making him very unhappy. In fourth stanza, Herbert Read speaks about this soldier killing a German by saying; "I saw him stab/And stab again/A well-killed Boche." This showed vengeance because earlier in the poem, Herbert tells us that this soldier is in pain, and wants to scream out but he cannot, so therefore he stabs this enemy, in hopes to take his revenge on them for forcing him to be fighting in this war. Symbolism is shown in this poem because the happy warrior symbolizes the image that all the soldiers have to put of themselves, as a strong, and happy warrior, completely proud of their decision to fight for their country. This poem helps my understanding of the war because it showed how the soldiers still fought through the pain because they had made the decision to fight for their countries.

    <div style='background:#FFFee3'>  <p style ="font-family: Lato; font-size: 16px">
    Mud and barbed wire <br>
Is where we are from<br>
Deadly gas and rapid fire<br>
With loud shots fired like the beat of a drum<br>
<br>
The night before Christmas<br>
And we soldiers spend it alone<br>
With no family to show love to<br>
With no lovers hand to hold<br>
<br>
There is talk about no fire<br>
To celebrate Christmas day<br>
<br>
We see the enemies above the trenches<br>
They wave their hands back and forth<br>
<br>
The ones who have caused so much pain<br>
So much sorrow<br>
Asking for the trust of no fire<br>
Asking for a celebration<br>
<br>
The thought of no more fighting<br>
No more death<br>
No more gas masks and blood drops<br>
No more broken boots, and sand bags<br>
<br>
All the men rush out to No man's land<br>
Champagne and games<br>
Cheers and screams<br>
For a second the war seems to be over<br>
<br>
But then the sun comes up<br>
And the miraculous trust is gone<br>
The war must continue<br>
And the rest of the pain has begun<br>
