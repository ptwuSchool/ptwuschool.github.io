	<p style ="font-family: Lato; font-size: 16px"><br>The darkness crumbles away.<br>
It is the same old druid Time as ever,<br>
Only a live thing leaps my hand,<br>
A queer sardonic rat,<br>
As I pull the parapet's poppy<br>
To stick behind my ear.<br>
Droll rat, they would shoot you if they knew<br>
Your cosmopolitan sympathies.<br>
Now you have touched this English hand<br>
You will do the same to a German<br>
Soon, no doubt, if it be your pleasure<br>
To cross the sleeping green between.<br>
It seems you inwardly grin as you pass<br>
Strong eyes, fine limbs, haughty athletes,<br>
Less chanced than you for life,<br>
Bonds to the whims of murder,<br>
Sprawled in the bowels of the earth,<br>
The torn fields of France.<br>
What do you see in our eyes<br>
At the shrieking iron and flame<br>
Hurled through still heavens?<br>
What quaver -- what heart aghast?<br>
Poppies whose roots are in man's veins<br>
Drop, and are ever dropping;<br>
But mine in my ear is safe --<br>
Just a little white with the dust.<br>

    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 20px">This poem describes what life might be like for the average infantryman fighting in the trenches during World War I.  Nearly every line in this poem has some reference to death, for it was all the fighting could think about, living in constant fear in the trenches.  For example, even when a person is pulling a parapet's poppy, he/she is committing an act of killing.  The author masterfully juxtaposes the situation of the soldiers to the life of a rat by writing,"It seems you inwardly grin as you pass/Strong eyes, fine limbs, haughty athletes/Less chanced than you for like/Bonds to the whims of murder" (Rosenberg 13-17).  The author is saying that the soldiers actually envy the life of the rats, which are usually regarded as some of the lowliest, most disregarded members of the animal kingdom.  The rats are free; they can venture to both British and German lines without being gunned down by maxims, and that is a freedom that the strong, athletic infantrymen do not have.  Finally, the author goes back to the idea of killing poppies, saying that they are actually very comparable to humans at war, for both poppies and humans "drop, and are ever dropping" (Rosenberg 24).  Even though more and more of the author's comrades are dropping in battle, the author still recognizes that his own poppy is still safe, but even then, it is stained by some dust, which may represent the fact that the author could be sent to his grave at any given moment.

	<h2 style ="color:grey; font-family: Open Sans; font-weight: light; font-size: 22px;">by Richard Molesworth Dennys</h2>

	</div>  
	<blockquote>
	<p style ="font-family: Lato; font-size: 16px"><br>Better far to pass away<br>
While the limbs are strong and young,<br>
Ere the ending of the day,<br>
Ere youth's lusty song be sung.<br>
Hot blood pulsing through the veins,<br>
Youth's high hope a burning fire,<br>
Young men needs must break the chains<br>
That hold them from their hearts' desire.<br>
<br>
My friends the hills, the sea, the sun,<br>
The winds, the woods, the clouds, the trees -<br>
How feebly, if my youth were done,<br>
Could I, an old man, relish these!<br>
With laughter, then, I'll go to greet<br>
What Fate has still in store for me,<br>
And welcome Death if we should meet,<br>
And bear him willing company.<br>
<br>
My share of fourscore years and ten<br>
I'll gladly yield to any man,<br>
And take no thought of "where" or "when,"<br>
Contented with my shorter span,<br>
For I have learned what love may be,<br>
And found a heart that understands,<br>
And known a comrade's constancy,<br>
And felt the grip of friendly hands.<br>
<br>
Come when it may, the stern decree<br>
For me to leave the cheery throng<br>
And quit the sturdy company<br>
Of brothers that I work among.<br>
No need for me to look askance,<br>
Since no regret my prospect mars.<br>
My day was happy - and perchance<br>
The coming night is full of stars.<br>

    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 20px">When Dennys was writing this poem, he was likely thinking that he would rather die than toil on in the war that was actually just a complete stalemate, given the situation with the trenches.  In the first two verses of this poem, the author communicates that he believes that people can only enjoy life as a youth, when their "limbs are strong and young," and with "hot blood pulsing through [their] veins" (Dennys 2, 5).  As a youth, he feels that he has already enjoyed all that life has to offer, saying that as long as he has love and camaraderie, he is content with life.  In the first verse, he also mentions that "Young men need to break the chains/That hold them from their hearts' desire" (Dennys 7-8).  This desire that men share is the desire to survive the war and to live to old age.  Dennys is criticizing those who have that desire, arguing that they should be fighting and even dying for their country, rather than trying to avoid the prospect of being shot.  If you don't valiantly fight for your country, you will have no place to live, never mind live to an old age.

   Out of every three or four officers,<br>
You could bet that two would get killed and what?<br>
You might-might-or might not get one prisoner.<br>
The trench raids go on day and night,<br>
The incessant fire of machine guns,<br>
Slaughtering raiders in particular.<br>
<br>
The dead were stretched out on one side,<br>
One on top of each other six feet high.<br>
These men tried to invade enemy lines,<br>
But now only the smell of their decaying flesh remains,<br>
I would rather have smelt gas a hundred times.<br>
<br>
Barbed wire so thick and tangled that it resembled,<br>
The House of Death itself, and as the soldiers trembled,<br>
The party leader gave an order and everyone reassembled,<br>
But in the end, the steel wall was still impenetrable.<br>
<br>
Sixty thousand men;<br>
Seven square miles;<br>
Do the math, but it's clear the effort wasn't worthwhile.<br>
<br>
The tunnel-visioned commanders,<br>
Playing their infantry like a chess game,<br>
But pawns are never promoted crossing the playing board alone.<br>

<blockquote><p style ="font-family: Lato; font-size: 16px">Through this work, I hope to be able to convey the message that trench warfare often resulted in large amount of casualties for both warring parties in return for very little gain of anything.  World War I was the greatest stalemate that the world had ever seen.
