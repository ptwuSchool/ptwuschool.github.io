	<blockquote>
	<p style ="font-family: Lato; font-size: 16px"><br>Dark clouds are smouldering into red<br>
  While down the craters morning burns.<br>
The dying soldier shifts his head<br>
  To watch the glory that returns;<br>
He lifts his fingers toward the skies<br>
  Where holy brightness breaks in flame;<br>
Radiance reflected in his eyes,<br>
  And on his lips a whispered name.<br>
<br>
You'd think, to hear some people talk,<br>
  That lads go West with sobs and curses,<br>
And sullen faces white as chalk,<br>
  Hankering for wreaths and tombs and hearses.<br>
But they've been taught the way to do it<br>
  Like Christian soldiers; not with haste<br>
And shuddering groans; but passing through it<br>
  With due regard for decent taste.<br>

    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 20px">Sadness, fright, sorrow. All these tones are present in this poem and are shown through word choice. For example, the phrases, "dark clouds are smoldering into red" "Dying soldier shifts his head" and "lads go West with sobs and curses." Even the name of the poem, "How to Die", gives a feeling of sorrow. Wreaths, tombs, and hearses are symbols in this poem and they symbolize death. The soldiers are hankering, wanting these things; wanting death. They would rather die then, than suffer fighting in war. But they've been taught to die fighting. Fighting in war is like a long painful death, according to the poem but the soldiers would rather die instantaneously.The poem shows how sorrowful the war was. It shows how much the soldiers were affected by it especially in the second stanza. The first stanza describes a soldier dying. Siegfried Sassoon was a soldier as well as a poet. His poems described the horror and brutality of trench warfare. However, before he went to war, the style of Siegfried's poems were romantic and sweet. Siegfried wrote a statement about his objection to the war which states, "I believe that this war, upon which I entered as a war of defense and liberation, has now become a war of aggression and conquest." This shows how he has negative views on war and that he did not have the same views before he actually fought.

	<blockquote>
	<p style ="font-family: Lato; font-size: 16px"><br>What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?<br>
--Only the monstrous anger of the guns.<br>
 Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle<br>
Can patter out their hasty orisons.<br>
No mockeries for them from prayers or bells,<br>
 Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs,-<br>
The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells;<br>
 And bugles calling for them from sad shires.<br>
<br>
What candles may be held to speed them all?<br>
 Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes<br>
Shall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes.<br>
 The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall;<br>
Their flowers the tenderness of silent minds,<br>
And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.<br>

<h2 class="section-heading" style="color:black; font-family: Lato; text-align: center">Analysis</h1>

	<div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 20px">"Anthem for a Doomed Youth." Thinking about this name gives me a strange feeling. The word "Anthem" has a joyful, victorious sense to it. However followed by, "for a Doomed Youth", there is a very gloomy,  sorrowful feel for the title.  Overall, this poem is full of melancholy. The second stanza talks about a boy's reaction to finding out a family member died in the war. "The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pal." This section of the poem is showing how the wives and girlfriends, of the soldier's, reaction to finding out their husbands have passed. In this poem, I believe that cattle are a symbol for people. It shows how many soldiers just died as if they were animals. The quote, "No mockeries for them from prayers or bell," is important in understanding this symbol. Cows are not honored for when they die, but the soldiers who die in war should be. This poem compares cow death to the death of a soldier and how they were treated the same way. Wilfred Owen himself was a British soldier in WWI. Siegfried Sassoon inspired Wilfred to write war poetry. A piece of a biography of Wilfred Owen says, "Within a week he had been transported to the front line in a cattle wagon." This may explain why he includes to possibly symbolize cattle as soldiers. "Anthem for a Doomed Youth" is successful in producing an understanding of how horrifying the war was. It is demonstrated in the poem how dead soldiers were not honored for what they did, comparing them to cattle. Also, the sadness families had when they found out that their family member passed in war, was conveyed through this poem.

    A night of happiness at last.<br>
Not thinking about future, nor past.<br>
Sir Horace Smith may be in anger<br>
At least no one is being gassed.<br>
<br>
The world disguises itself with beautiful things.<br>
Underneath the mask is an ugly truth,<br>
Of blood, hate, and war.<br>
But Holy Night has a naked beauty,<br>
Of love, warmth, and peace.<br>
<br>
Oh Holy Night stay awhile,<br>
Surely will make are people smile.<br>
Tomorrow will come and so will war,<br>
Torture and pain, mile after mile.<br>
<br>
Why can't every night be this way,<br>
Playing football day to day.<br>
Up in heaven is where i'll be,<br>
Where I can finally be free.<br>
