	You would not know him now...<br>

	Nobly, so cover him over<br>
	With violets of pride<br>
	Purple from Severn side.<br>

	And with thick-set<br>
	Masses of memoried flowers-<br>
	Hide that red wet<br>
	Thing I must somehow forget.<br>

	<div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 20px">The tone of the piece is very sad and full of sorrow. Gurney starts off each stanza explaining the death of a friend. The first few lines of each stanza is the statement and emotion of the actual death of the soldier whereas the last few lines connect with nature and places in England.The soldier mentions places where they created memories and reflects back on their adventures. Gurney mentions different places like "Cotswolds" and "Severn River", representing life and the humour from the dead soldier.  Towards the end of the piece, he also uses the phrase "thick set masses of memoried flowers" to hide all the horrors of war and the body underneath. Gurney writes this as if a soldier is writing to the wife of the dead soldier. He writes to remind her of all the great times they had with him. The way Gurney writes, reflects on how he survived and conquered all the obstacles and finally was able to die courageously and peacefully.</h3>

	<blockquote>
	<p style ="font-family: Lato; font-size: 16px"><br>I have come to the borders of sleep,<br>
The unfathomable deep<br>
Forest where all must lose<br>
Their way, however straight,<br>
Or winding, soon or late;<br>
They cannot choose.<br>
<br>
Many a road and track<br>
That, since the dawn's first crack,<br>
Up to the forest brink,<br>
Deceived the travellers,<br>
Suddenly now blurs,<br>
And in they sink.<br>
<br>
Here love ends,<br>
Despair, ambition ends;<br>
All pleasure and all trouble,<br>
Although most sweet or bitter,<br>
Here ends in sleep that is sweeter<br>
Than tasks most noble.<br>
There is not any book<br>
Or face of dearest look<br>
That I would not turn from now<br>
To go into the unknown<br>
I must enter and leave, alone,<br>
I know not how.<br>
<br>
The tall forest towers;<br>
Its cloudy foliage lowers<br>
Ahead, shelf above shelf;<br>
Its silence I hear and obey<br>
That I may lose my way<br>
And myself.<br>

    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 20px">This poem describes death, a welcoming idea of peace and rest. Edward Thomas encourages the idea that death was the answer to all the problems and troubles of war. Thomas writes the second stanza as if he is on a meaningful journey yet the destination is death. He uses the phrase,  "Many a road and track....Deceived their travellers," creating an image of a journey. He repeats the word "ends" in the third stanza as a sign that death relieves a person of pain, forgetting the dreadful memories of war. He starts off referring to sleep as a time to forget all mistakes and prepare for the new day. He continues to mention how sleep can release bad energy and revive happiness and peace. The author communicates how death and sleep can be peaceful and sorrowless. He describes sleep and death as a time to forget all the troubles, "[The] forest where all must lose." He constantly repeats the word "forest" throughout the poem; representing getting lost in thoughts and being able to forget or lose their bad memories of that day. He closes the poem with the mysteries of death and leaving your life behind.

The silence pierces<br>
Blurry vision<br>
And hazy voices<br>
All is gone <br>
No one left <br>
