	You would not know him now...<br>
	But still he died<br>
	Nobly, so cover him over<br>
	With violets of pride<br>
	Purple from Severn side.<br>

	Cover him, cover him soon!<br>
	And with thick-set<br>
	Masses of memoried flowers-<br>
	Hide that red wet<br>
	Thing I must somehow forget.<br>

    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 20px">The tone of the piece is very sad and full of sorrow. Gurney starts off each stanza explaining the death of a friend. The first few lines of each stanza is the statement and emotion of the actual death of the soldier whereas the last few lines connect with nature and places in England.The soldier mentions places where they created memories and reflects back on their adventures. Gurney mentions different places like "Cotswolds" and "Severn River", representing life and the humour from the dead soldier.  Towards the end of the piece, he also uses the phrase "thick set masses of memoried flowers" to hide all the horrors of war and the body underneath. Gurney writes this as if a soldier is writing to the wife of the dead soldier. He </h3>

	<blockquote>
	<p style ="font-family: Lato; font-size: 16px"><br>I have come to the borders of sleep,<br>
The unfathomable deep<br>
Forest where all must lose<br>
Their way, however straight,<br>
Or winding, soon or late;<br>
They cannot choose.<br>
<br>
Many a road and track<br>
That, since the dawn's first crack,<br>
Up to the forest brink,<br>
Deceived the travellers,<br>
Suddenly now blurs,<br>
And in they sink.<br>
<br>
Here love ends,<br>
Despair, ambition ends;<br>
All pleasure and all trouble,<br>
Although most sweet or bitter,<br>
Here ends in sleep that is sweeter<br>
Than tasks most noble.<br>
There is not any book<br>
Or face of dearest look<br>
That I would not turn from now<br>
To go into the unknown<br>
I must enter and leave, alone,<br>
I know not how.<br>
<br>
The tall forest towers;<br>
Its cloudy foliage lowers<br>
Ahead, shelf above shelf;<br>
Its silence I hear and obey<br>
That I may lose my way<br>
And myself.<br>
