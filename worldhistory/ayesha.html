Not with this wind blowing, and this tide.<br>
"Has any one else had word of him?"<br>
Not this tide.<br>
For what is sunk will hardly swim,<br>
Not with this wind blowing, and this tide.<br>
"Oh, dear, what comfort can I find?"<br>
None this tide,<br>
Nor any tide,<br>
Except he did not shame his kind --<br>
Not even with that wind blowing, and that tide.<br>
Then hold your head up all the more,<br>
This tide,<br>
And every tide;<br>
Because he was the son you bore,<br>
And gave to that wind blowing and that tide!<br>

    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 20px">The tone of this poem is melancholy and regretful. Kipling had a son named John who died fighting in the war, but he was put on the "missing believed wounded" list for about two years, which explains why in his poem Kipling was constantly asking about Jack-who symbolizes his son John. Kipling was very distraught after he found out his son had died, because he had pushed his son to join the military. "Jack" symbolizes John, as well as all the people who lost their lives in the war, and Kipling represents the families of those people who were sacrificed to the war. The tide and the winds symbolize the harshness of the conditions and the hardships that soldiers lose their lives too. The poem shows the regret Kipling felt for pushing his son, but the pride he felt that his son died for his country, fighting very courageously and fulfilling his duty. This poem really shows the loss Kipling felt. He was the man who wrote the poem "White Man's Burden" pushing the war on, praising white men and war and their duties. But when he lost his son to war, to fulfilling the "white man's duty", his feelings towards war probably declined as Jack was the second child he had lost. No matter how much pride Kipling felt, the regret of pushing his son because of his own beliefs in war overrides his feelings.</h3>

	<h2 style ="color:grey; font-family: Open Sans; font-weight: light; font-size: 22px;">by Charlotte Mew</h2>
	<br>
	</div>  
	<blockquote>
	<p style ="font-family: Lato; font-size: 16px"><br>Not yet will those measureless fields be green again<br>
Where only yesterday the wild sweet blood of wonderful youth was shed;<br>
There is a grave whose earth must hold too long, too deep a stain,<br>
Though for ever over it we may speak as proudly as we may tread.<br>
But here, where the watchers by lonely hearts from the thrust of an inward sword have more slowly bled,<br>
We shall build the Cenotaph: Victory, winged, with Peace, winged too, at the column's head.<br>
And over the stairway, at the foot - oh! here, leave desolate, passionate hands to spread<br>
Violets, roses, and laurel with the small sweet twinkling country things<br>
Speaking so wistfully of other Springs<br>
From the little gardens of little places where son or sweetheart was born and bred.<br>
In splendid sleep, with a thousand brothers<br>
To lovers - to mothers<br>
Here, too, lies he:<br>
Under the purple, the green, the red,<br>
It is all young life: it must break some women's hearts to see<br>
Such a brave, gay coverlet to such a bed!<br>
Only, when all is done and said,<br>
God is not mocked and neither are the dead.<br>
For this will stand in our Market-place -<br>
Who'll sell, who'll buy<br>
(Will you or I<br>
Lie each to each with the better grace)?<br>
While looking into every busy whore's and huckster's face<br>
As they drive their bargains, is the Face<br>
Of God: and some young, piteous, murdered face.<br>

    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 20px">The tone of this poem is prideful as well as sorrow and vengeance.. The word "cenotaph" is Greek, and it means "empty tomb." It is a monument on Whitehall in London which started as a temporary structure for the peace parade at the end of World War I. However, this structure ended up becoming a monument to commemorate those who died fighting for Britain in the war. In fact, in the monument is inscribed "The Glorious Dead." Mew talks about the men who lost their lives and celebrates their actions and sacrifices. She also mentions the public commemoration of those who died, when she talks about "under the purple, the green, the read, It is all young life." The cenotaph symbolizes prideful soldiers who fought for the country. When Mew says "some young, piteous, murdered face", this shows the loss people felt as they heard that their loved ones had died. This poem shows how after soldiers were killed and people were sad, they were inspired first to build this for the peace parade to show that the war was over, but then wanted to keep it as a symbol of honor. It now still stands today as a symbol of both World War British soldiers. As some do not see the value of the monument, "while looking into every usy whore's and huckster's face," Charlotte Mew uses the monument to explain how people felt towards the war and the soldiers, and the poem itself celebrates the braveness of soldiers.

    Gone.<br>
Just like that, gone.<br>
In the blink of an eye,<br>
Without a goodbye.<br>
<br>
Shot through the heart,<br>
Killed in the fight,<br>
His soul, his spirit<br>
Lasted through the night.<br>
<br>
Sorrow filled the room faster than light,<br>
As the message was delivered, he died in the fight<br>
Tears ran down the faces of his loves,<br>
Feeling regret and feeling fright.<br>
<br>
But then they had realized,<br>
Their brother had died with pride.<br>
For his family, for his bride,<br>
For his country he had died. <br>
<br>
The pride would not resurface,<br>
The courage could not mask<br>
The grief his loves had felt<br>
While he accomplished his task.<br>
<br>
But he was to be remembered,<br>
Honored and praised,<br>
For he had fought in the war<br>
And though his time was no more<br>
His memory would last<br>
And be adored.<br>
